        <h3>
            Now my creators will give you some information about themselves!!!
        </h3>
        <p>Hello! We are the creators of this website: Eleni and Leo<br> We made this website in 2024 for our
            Application Development class (CS 343). We are both currently sophomore computer science majors at James
            Madison University.This website is meant to use two databases and pull information from them to do
            something fun. First we use the movie name given to retrieve the rating that movie has and return it
            using Movie Lover. Afterwards we use that same movie name to get a GIF of the movie and make your day.
